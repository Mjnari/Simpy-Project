Limitations:
    No well supported way to add to resources - I wanted to add more servers when the 
    line got too full but documentation shows no reasonable support for this was to
    use simpy containers or simpy store. This was frustrating to maintain because 
    both of these require manual request and release, so I removed this feature. 

    Not easy to customize resources - I wanted to give the servers different shifts
    and skill levels, but there's no native support for this.

    No built in ways to effectively manipulate the queue at scale - I wanted to clear the queue
    at the end of each day. Simpy doesn't natively support this. Building this myself
    was trivial so I still added it, but surprising it is not supported. This is much
    smoother in Arena

    No built in analysis tools - I had to code all of the analysis myself. This is much
    smoother in Arena.

    Requires somewhat significant Python knowledge


Pros:
    Someone who is good at Python will pick this up much more quickly than learning Arena

Misc:  
    Numbers were arbitrarily picked based on what looked decent when I ran the sim
