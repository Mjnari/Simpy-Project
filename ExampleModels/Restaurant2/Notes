Limitations:
    No well supported way to add to resources - I wanted to add more servers when the 
    line got too full but documentation shows no reasonable support for this was to
    use simpy containers or simpy store. This was frustrating to maintain because 
    both of these require manual request and release, so I removed this feature. 

    Not easy to customize resources - I wanted to give the servers different shifts
    and skill levels, but there's no native support for this.
