Limitations compared to Arena:
    No well supported way to add more resources - I wanted to add more servers when the 
    line got too full but documentation shows no reasonable support for this. The docs say
    to use simpy containers or simpy store instead of simpy resources. This was frustrating 
    to maintain because both of these require manual request and release which would take a 
    significant refactor, so I decided not to add more resources.

    Not easy to customize resources - I wanted to give the servers different shifts
    and skill levels, but there's no native support for this.

    No built in ways to effectively manipulate the queue at scale - I wanted to clear the queue
    at the end of each day. Simpy doesn't natively support this. Building this myself
    was trivial so I still added it, but surprising it is not supported. This is much
    smoother in Arena

    No built in analysis tools - I had to code all of the analysis myself. This is much
    smoother in Arena. This also meant I struggled to find a clean way to run all the
    analysis after the simulation was run. To mostly circumvent this, I ran my analysis at
    the end of each day

    Requires somewhat significant Python knowledge

    No native support for graphics like in Arena


Pros compared to Arena:
    Someone who is good at Python will pick this up much more quickly than learning Arena

    Anything the framework does not support can usually be handled by native Python or by
    working with other Python libraries/frameworks. In Arena anything that Arena does not
    support is often not so simple to workaround.

Misc:  
    Numbers were arbitrarily picked based on what looked decent when I ran the sim and 
    educated guesses on what best reflected reality

    Sim time is arbitrary but the examples in the documentation uses minutes
